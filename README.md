### 👋 About:

Created as an academic project for the [WMDD program at Langara](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html), the purpose of this project was to develop a business-to-business (B2B) application within 13 weeks. RestaurantPro is the ultimate solution for efficient task tracking and employee performance management in the restaurant industry. Our app helps restaurants streamline their workflow and distribute tasks efficiently among the team, serving as an enhanced alternative to traditional methods of recording employees' activity by hand.
